<p>In this scenario, we have two distinct applications (App1 and App2) that simulate two different purpose APIs that
    "listen" to the same topic (Chat).</p>

<p>Each of the apps has its own consumer group (g1 and g2), so each message produced is sent to both apps at the same time.</o>

<p>The idea of ​​this scenario is to demonstrate a form of retry in which an error message is routed
    to another topic (Chat.retry. [number]) to be read again. Each retry topic must have an exponential delay.
    to avoid bottleneck.</p>
<p>In this example we have 3 attempts, each with a longer delay than the other. If no attempt succeeds
    process the message then this message should go to the final topic: DLQ (Dead letter queue).</p>
<p>The downside to this implementation is that it will need to triple the infrastructure of the main topic to
    all retry topics if you want to separate each retry app into an isolated docker container, that is, they must have database access or any other access.

<strong>Steps to simulate retry queues when both apps (App1 and App2) generate errors:</strong>

<ol>
    <li>Click the "Subscribe all" button to turn on all "listeners"</li>
    <li>Keep the "Simulate error in next message" checkbox checked on all "listeners" so that all "listeners" generate errors.</li>
    <li>Wait for the message to arrive at the "DLQ" topic after all attempts in both apps.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Steps to simulate retry queues in just one of the apps (App1):</strong>

<ol>
    <li>Click the "Subscribe all" button to turn on all "listeners"</li>
    <li>Keep the "Simulate error in next message" checkbox checked on all "listeners" except "app2" so that only it does not generate an error.</li>
    <li>Wait for the message to arrive at the "DLQ" topic after all attempts.</li>
