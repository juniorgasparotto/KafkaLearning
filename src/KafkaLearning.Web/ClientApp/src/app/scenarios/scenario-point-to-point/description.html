<p>Point to Point means message(s) is sent from one application(producer or sender) to another application(consumer/receiver) via a queue. There can be more than one consumer listening on a queue but only one of them will be get the message. Hence it is Point to Point or One to One.</p>

<p>In this scenario, we have two distinct applications (App1 and App2) that simulate two different purpose APIs that "listen" to the same topic (Chat).</p>

<p>Both applications use the same consumer group ID and only one will receive the message.</o>

<strong>Steps to simulate:</strong>

<ol>
    <li>Click the "Subscribe all" button to turn on all "listeners"</li>
    <li>One application will receive the message and the other will not.</li>
